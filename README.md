# Bear
A UCI chess engine written entirely by ChatGPT o1.

This engine is not for testing yet, and probably never will be. It was originally an ANSI C project, but, as happens with ChatGPT, it forgot that I had asked, so now it no longer is.

This engine could be used for teaching purposes, for development by someone who actually knows how to code, for further development by someone else using AI, etc.
